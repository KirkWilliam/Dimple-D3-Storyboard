# Dimple-D3-Storyboard

This is an interactive storyboard using a combination of D3 and Dimple. 

Once the dashboard is rendered, the user can select a certain period (1 of 13 Cycles in this case) or watch the storyboard flow from one cycle to another.

This view allows the user to see Top Clients (x-axis) spend by store (color of bubble) by product category (y-axis).
